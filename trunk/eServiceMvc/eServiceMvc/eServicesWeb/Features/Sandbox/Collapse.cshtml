        In addition to the disassembly, Functions, and Output windows, IDA opens a
        number of other tabbed windows on your IDA desktop. These tabs are present
        just under the navigation band (see 􀁚 in Figure 4-9). These windows are
        used to provide alternate or specialized views into the database. The utility
        of these displays depends on both the characteristics of the binary you are
        analyzing and your skill with IDA. Several of these windows are sufficiently
        specialized to require more detailed coverage in later chapters.

        In its default configuration, IDA creates seven (as of version 6.1) display windows
        during the initial loading-and-analysis phase for a new binary. Each of
        these display windows is accessible via a set of title tabs displayed immediately
        beneath the navigation band (shown previously in Figure 4-9). The three
        immediately visible windows are the IDA-View window, the Functions window,
        and the Output window. Whether or not they are open by default, all of the
        windows discussed in this chapter can be opened via the View􀀗Open Subviews
        menu. Keep this fact in mind, as it is fairly easy to inadvertently close
        the display windows.
        The ESC key is one of the more useful hotkeys in all of IDA. When the
        disassembly window is active, the ESC key functions in a manner similar to
        a web browser’s back button and is therefore very useful in navigating the
        disassembly display (navigation is covered in detail in Chapter 6). Unfortunately,
        when any other window is active, the ESC key serves to close the window.
        Occasionally, this is exactly what you want. At other times, you will
        immediately wish you had that closed window back.

        A tremendous amount of activity takes place within the IDA desktop during
        the initial autoanalysis of a newly opened file. You can gain an understanding
        of this analysis by observing various desktop displays during the analysis process.
        Desktop activity you may observe includes the following:
        􀁺 Progress messages printed to the Output window
        􀁺 Initial location and disassembly output generated for the disassembly
        window
        􀁺 Initial population of the Functions window, followed by periodic updates
        as the analysis progresses
        􀁺 Transformation of the navigation band as new areas of the binary are
        recognized as code and data, blocks of code are further recognized as
        functions, and, finally, functions are recognized specifically as library
        code using IDA’s pattern-matching techniques
        􀁺 The current position indicator traversing the navigation band to show
        the regions currently being analyzed
        The following output is representative of messages generated by IDA
        during the initial analysis of a newly opened binary file. Notice that the
        messages form a narrative of the analysis process and offer insight into the
        sequence of operations performed by IDA during that analysis.
