After using AutoMapper on a couple of projects I have stopped using it. 
The problem is that the convention based mappings introduce annoying bugs when property names change or the object graph changes. 
When a change breaks the convention it results in a runtime exception. Very annoying.

1. If you use the convention-based mapping (which is easy way to go) 
   and a property is later renamed that becomes a runtime error 
   and a common source of annoying bugs. 
2. If you don't use convention-based mapping (ie you explicitly map each property) 
   then you are just using automapper to do your projection, which is unnecessary complexity.
   And amount of code is on-par with hand-crafted mappers. In AutoMapper case you have to learn to use it. 
   Hand-crafter is just plain and fast C# code.
